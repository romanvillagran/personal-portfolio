        <p style="color:white">Hello my name is Roman Villagran. I am 18 years old. I've lived in california my whole life. I love to play videogames with my friends. my favorite videogame is Elden ring, the reason why I love this game is because it has a perfect balance of difficulty and beauty. My plans for the future is to graduate college in the stem field, get a good job and help my family out with whatever they need.
